once gitkraken is downloaded, sign in to it with your github account
then access preferences in the top right
navigate to the authentication tab
click the generate key and add to git hub button

after that click the file icon in the top left
choose to clone a repo
select from github
choose the project-dante repository

once this is complete, we have gitkraken installed and ready to go

you now have the same unity project that i do
simply open unity and navigate to the folder you downloaded the repo into
be careful to select the "project Dante" folder inside the "project-dante" repository
otherwise, you will create a project that is brand new and has our game inside it
it causes all sorts of problems

then in the next meeting we can go over how we will gitkraken to work on the game
