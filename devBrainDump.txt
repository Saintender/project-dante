trello list still includes: clone, jumpity joe, campfire healing

next on my list will likely be the clone property, being the cornerstone of our game
my current working theory is that i need to add another mask that player collides with
that mask will only be for clones
then upon right mouse click, create game object player clone
transparency this down
while right clicked, clone copies action of player
then need to store it somehow
then loop it
will likely need some kind of escape key to delete clones

First things first:

get the right mouse to create clone that stays put

I'm thinking right now that it might be best to handle the clone like a moving platform
during the input, the player script could collect an array of transforms and then the clone would follow that set of transforms as a path
if this will work then i need to concept out the collision between the character and clone during creation

first things first: lets get a clone working on a path
